A 'yolo.weights' file is required to run this code. 

 Download the pre-trained YOLO v3 weights file from this [link](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights) and place it in the current directory or you can directly download to the current directory in terminal using
 
 `$ wget https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights`
 
 Provided all the files are in the current directory, below command will apply object detection on the input image `dog.jpg`.
 
 `$ python yolo_opencv.py --i <path-to-image>`
