# Computer Vision Samples

A set of sample computer vision codes for those who want to learn such skills.
The codes are basically based on OpenCV platform. But may include other platforms.
A big part of the repo includes my activities and homeworks during the CV-course I had in 2019.
I still add every single-task CV skill I learn.
